# Obsidian GNU/Linux
ObsidianOS is an Arch-based Linux distro with an A/B partition style so if a package has a breaking change that causes some issues, you can just reboot into the other partition and restore the other one, while relying on the robustness of EXT4.

This distro is a work in progress.
